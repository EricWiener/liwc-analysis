# liwc-analysis
This package serves as a driver for the LIWC2015 .txt dictionary. The dictionary is not included and can be purchased directly from LIWC.

## Usage
The usage is fairly straight forward. First import the package
```python
import liwcanalysis
```

Then you need to create an instance of the LIWC analysis with the path to the .txt file.
```python
LIWCLocation = "/Users/Eric/repositories/transcript-analysis/LIWC/LIWC.2015.all.txt"
LIWC = liwcanalysis.liwc(LIWCLocation)
```

Then you can pass in a list of strings to analyze to receive a tuple of results dictionary and count dictionary.
```python
transcripts = {
    "Example1": "This is a single transcript. Red hat angry.",
    "Example2": "This is another single transcript. Dog boy cat.",
}

str_list = []
for key in transcripts:
    str_list.append(transcripts[key])

result_dics, count_dics = LIWC.analyze(str_list)
```

Please note that `analyze()` can take either a single string argument or a list of strings. Example:
```python
# this is valid
result_dics, coutn_dics = LIWC.analyze(["this is a string", "here is another", "one more"])
# this is also valid
result_dics, coutn_dics = LIWC.analyze("this is a string")
```

`result_dics` is a list of dictionaries. Each dictionary corresponds to one of the strings passed into `analyze`. Each dictionary follows the form of `"LIWC Category": [list, of, words, matched]`. For instance the dictionary for one string might look something like:
```
{
    "FUNCTION": ["is", "a"],
    "QUANT": ["single"],
    ...
}
```

`count_dics` is very similar to `result_dics`, but instead of giving a list of words matched, it gives the length of each list of words matched:
```
{
    "FUNCTION": 2,
    "QUANT": 1,
    ...
}
```

Finally, you can print out the results to csv using:
```python
LIWC.print(output_dir, titles)
```
You need to specify the output directory, as well as a list of titles for each string. See the full example for more details.

You can also retrieve an alphabetically sorted (A->Z) list of LIWC categories using `LIWC.get_categories()`.

## Full Example
```python
import liwcanalysis

transcripts = {
    "Example1": "This is a single transcript. Red hat angry.",
    "Example2": "This is another single transcript. Dog boy cat.",
}

str_list = []
for key in transcripts:
    strs.append(transcripts[key])

LIWCLocation = "/Users/Downloads/LIWC/LIWC.2015.all.txt"
output_dir = "/Path/to/my/file/"

LIWC = liwcanalysis.liwc(LIWCLocation)
result_dics, count_dics = LIWC.analyze(str_list)
LIWC.print(output_dir, list(transcript.keys()))
```
Using print will return the following tables:
